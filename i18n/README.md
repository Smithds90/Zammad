# Zammad Text Modules - `i18n/text_modules/*.yml`

Zammad text modules are automatically imported when the first admin user is created, according to this user's language.
This is just meant to provide for a smooth start with some existing helpful text modules. They can be modified later on;
no subsequent import from the example files will be performed.

Feel free to send pull requests to add more helpful examples to existing files or even files for new languages.
