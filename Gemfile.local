# Want to extend Zammad with additional gems?
# ZAMMAD USERS: Specify them in Gemfile.local
#               (That way, you can customize the Gemfile
#               without having your changes overwritten during upgrades.)
# ZAMMAD DEVS:  Consult the internal wiki
#               (or else risk pushing unwanted changes to Gemfile.lock!)
